## Written Reflection

# 1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
    # Before beginning Iteration 3, we huddled on Slack to plan. We created the Main Menu welcome message part together using pair programming techniques. Then over the weekend we decided that I will work on the computer ship placement set up and Jackson work on the Player Ship placement set up. We both created pull requests to review each others code before merging. Jackson worked on the Turn functionality and I worked on the End Game functionality.
# 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    # work on iteration 4, refactoring
# 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
    # we used driver/navigator in the beginning of the project and used Ping Pong method: Jackson wrote tests and I wrote the method to pass those tests.
# 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
    # we mostly shared feedback during our pair programming sessions as we were writing the code together.
    # each of us created branches, pull requests to review each other's code.
